[list]
[*][size=4]Avoid stacking multiple configurations for the same objects, as this can lead to overly bright lights.[/size]
[*][size=4][b]Mixing with ENB Light[/b]: from CS version 1.4 ENB Light is not supported from the side of CS so there is no point in worrying about this.[/size]

[center][size=4][b]Compatibility[/b][/size][/center]
[list]
[*]Designed for use with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135488]True light[/url] or any other interior lighting mods, provided that configurations are not stacked
[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99768]LLF Particle lights instead of fake glow[/url] - places many particle lights based on billboard texture names, [b]not recommended[/b] to use in combination with this mod
[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65720]Particle Patch[/url] - places particle lights but they are per default inactive when using latest Community Shaders, so [b]compatible[/b] (if no [i]pp_black.ini[/i] was created manually)
[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56362]ENB lights for effect shaders[/url] - places lights for effect shaders, [b]overlaps[/b] with "Magic FX lights" option
[*]Any mod that places ENB lights like [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40991]More lights for ENB SE - Glowing mushrooms[/url] - [b]compatible[/b] if the option in the installer is not used, otherwise double lighting
[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22574]ENB light[/url] - many overlaps so there will be [b]double lighting[/b] if the options in the installers are not carefully checked against each other. The  magic effects not handled by CS light currently are explosions and impacts, so those won't overlap. Note that projectiles are handled by Light Limit Fix already so ENB light is not needed.

[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27732]Luminous Atronachs[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/138128]iLluminous Elementals[/url] - CS light does not place lights for atronachs, so [b]fully compatible[/b]
